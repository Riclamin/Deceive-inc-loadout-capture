TODOS:
- for 1.0 release: Write backend for twitch extension server hosting

Maybe:
- Add support for disguise tier. 

Removed
- create gui? - Not useful anymore since the scripts are run separately.
- add customisable hotkeys - possible through Firebot since 0.4
- add notification that capture succeeded - not useful anymore since update commands in 0.5
